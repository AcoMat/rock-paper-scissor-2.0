## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- Google Gemini API key

### Client Setup
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/rock-paper-scissors-2.0.git

# Navigate to client directory
cd rock-paper-scissors-2.0/client

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the client application
npm run dev
```

### Server Setup
```bash
# Navigate to server directory
cd rock-paper-scissors-2.0/server

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Navigate to src directory
cd /src

echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here" > .env

# Start the server
npm start server.js
```

## Environment Variables

The server requires the following environment variables:
- `GEMINI_API_KEY` - Your Google Gemini API key for AI logic generation

## AI Integration / Custom Objects

Players can create custom objects by typing in a name. The project uses Google's Generative AI (Gemini 2.0 Flash model) to create dynamic game logic for custom objects, creating a dynamic and unique rock-paper-scissors variant with your custom items.

The AI ensures that:
- Every object has relationships with all other objects
- There are no contradictions (if A beats B, B cannot beat A)
- Each object has a unique emoji
- Each object has at least one winning and one losing relationship
- The logic for each relationship is explained
